#For this project, I downloaded NASA Astronaut data from Kaggle.
#Then I created a table to insert NASA Astronaut data into.
#Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL.

#Here is creating the table:
CREATE TABLE astronauts(
   Name                TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
   Year                INTEGER NOT NULL,
   GroupNum            INTEGER NOT NULL,
   Status              TEXT NOT NULL,
   Birth_Date          TEXT NOT NULL,
   Birth_Place         TEXT NOT NULL,
   Gender              TEXT NOT NULL,
   Alma_Mater          TEXT,
   Undergraduate_Major TEXT,
   Graduate_Major      TEXT,
   Military_Rank       TEXT,
   Military_Branch     TEXT,
   Space_Flights       INTEGER NOT NULL,
   Space_Flight_hr     INTEGER NOT NULL,
   Space_Walks         INTEGER NOT NULL,
   Space_Walks_hr      REAL NOT NULL,
   Missions            TEXT NOT NULL,
   Death_Date          TEXT, 
   Death_Mission       TEXT);
   
#Next I inserted NASA Astronaut data .csv into the table.
   
#Then I explored the data using the following SQL.

#First, I determined the average space flight hours of female and male astronauts.
SELECT Gender, avg(Space_Flight_hr)
FROM astronauts
GROUP BY gender;

#Second, I determined which male and female astronauts had the highest number of space walks.
SELECT Name, Gender, MAX(Space_Walks)
FROM astronauts
GROUP BY gender;

#Next, I wanted to see the top 10 astronauts that had the highest number of space walks! 
SELECT Name, Gender, Space_Walks
FROM astronauts
ORDER BY Space_Walks desc
LIMIT 10;

#I found which branches of military had astronauts with more than 5 space walks.
SELECT Name, Military_Branch, Space_Walks
FROM astronauts
GROUP BY Military_Branch
HAVING Space_Walks > 5;

#Similarly, I found which branches of military had astronauts with more than 2 space walks and more than 3 space flights.
SELECT Name, Military_Branch, Space_Flights, Space_Walks
FROM astronauts
GROUP BY Military_Branch
HAVING Space_Walks > 2 AND Space_Flights > 3;

#Lastly, I determined how many female and male astronauts were active at the time the data was recorded.
SELECT Gender, COUNT(Status) AS ActiveAstronauts 
FROM astronauts where Status = "Active"
GROUP BY Gender;

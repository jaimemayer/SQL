-- For this project, I downloaded Amazon Consumer Survey data from Kaggle. 
-- Then I created a table to insert the data into.

CREATE TABLE consumer_behavior (
	survey_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY
	, age INTEGER
	, gender VARCHAR
	, purchase_frequency VARCHAR
	, purchase_category_1 VARCHAR NULL
	, purchase_category_2 VARCHAR NULL
	, purchase_category_3 VARCHAR NULL
	, purchase_category_4 VARCHAR NULL
	, purchase_category_5 VARCHAR NULL
	, personalized_recommendation_purchase_frequency VARCHAR
	, browsing_frequency VARCHAR
	, product_search_method VARCHAR
	, search_result_exploration VARCHAR
	, customer_reviews_importance INTEGER
	, add_to_cart_browsing VARCHAR
	, cart_completion_frequency VARCHAR
	, cart_abandonment_factors VARCHAR
	, saveforlater_frequency VARCHAR
	, review_left VARCHAR
	, review_reliability VARCHAR
	, review_helpfulness VARCHAR
	, personalized_recommendation_frequency INTEGER
	, recommendation_helpfulness VARCHAR
	, rating_accuracy INTEGER
	, shopping_satisfaction INTEGER
	, service_appreciation VARCHAR
	, improvement_areas VARCHAR

-- Then, I inserted the data .csv into the table
-- Finally, I explored the data and answered the following questions using SQL.

-- Below, I created four different tables in order to better visualize data in Tableau when connecting to the data source:

-- table to isolate survey_id’s and purchase categories

CREATE TABLE categories AS

	, purchase_category_2
	, purchase_category_3

-- table to combine all purchase categories into one column with survey_id’s and remove blanks

UNION 
SELECT 
survey_id
, purchase_category_2 as Purchase_Categories

UNION
SELECT

, purchase_category_3 as Purchase_Categories
FROM categories
UNION
SELECT 
survey_id
, purchase_category_4 as Purchase_Categories
FROM categories
UNION
SELECT 
survey_id
, purchase_category_5 as ‘Purchase_Categories’
FROM categories;

DELETE FROM categories_reduced
WHERE length(Purchase_Categories) = 0;

-- table to group age into demographic groups

CREATE TABLE age_demographic AS

-- table to label personalized recommendation frequency qualitatively
